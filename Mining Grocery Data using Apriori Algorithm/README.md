## Objective
Market Basket Aalysis is widely used by superstores for the following things-
#### 1. `Cross Selling`
#### 2. `Product Placement`
#### 3. `Customer Segmentation`
#### 4. `Affinity Promotion`

So keeping the above mentioned importances of Market Basket Analysis, the experiment was conducted on Grocery data to come up with sound business decisions to scale up the revenue.

## Tools & Algorithm used
The experiment was done in both Python & R using `Apriori Algorithm`

## Dataset description
The data was collected from an online source. The Grocery data is typical transaction data tabuled in sparse matrix format.The dataset has 9836 transaction instances(Rows), 32(columns) items appearing in sparse matrix form.
